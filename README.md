## Installation Instructions

### 1. Install the Required Package

To install the Caller package, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
composer require alisons/caller
```
````

### 2. Publish Vendor Assets

Next, publish the vendor assets with the following command:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish
```

When prompted, select the option for `Alisons\Caller\CallerServiceProvider`.

### 3. Run Migration

Run the migration to install the necessary database table:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

This will create the required tables in your database for the caller functionality.

### 4. Update Views

By default, the application uses Laravel Breeze's `layouts->app` as its layout. If you're using a different layout, you need to update the references:

1. Navigate to `vendor/alisons/caller/resources/views/layout/main.blade.php` and change the layout reference to match your application layout.
2. The package uses a section called `caller-wrapper`. In your layout file, add a `@yield('caller-wrapper')` where you want the caller section to appear.

### 5. Add Content Yeild

By default, the application uses Laravel Breeze's `layouts->app` as its layout. If you're using a different layout, you need to update the references:

@yield('caller-wrapper')

## Accessing the Caller Settings

Once the package is installed, you can access the Caller settings at the following URL:

```
your-application-path/caller/caller
```

This is the page where you can configure the caller functionality for your application.

---

## Configuring the Caller in Your Application

To enable the caller functionality, you need to include the JavaScript library on the page where you want to use it.

### Add the Script

Add the following script to the `<head>` section of your layout file:

```html
<script src="{{ asset('caller/js/caller.js') }}"></script>
```

This ensures that the JavaScript necessary for the caller functionality is loaded.

### Add Phone Numbers

Next, place the phone number(s) using the following format within your view:

```html
<a class="caller" data-number="{{ echo your number here }}"
  >{{ number field here }}</a
>
```

Ensure that the number is placed in the `data-number` attribute and the visible number is placed inside the anchor tag.
